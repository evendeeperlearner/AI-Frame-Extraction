# FFmpeg + DINOv3 Adaptive Frame Extraction - Implementation Strategy

## 1. Technical Viability Assessment
- **Viable**: The concept is technically sound and feasible
- **Core Concept Validation**: DINOv3's dense visual features can effectively identify regions with rich visual details that benefit SfM reconstruction
- **Technical Correctness**: Using semantic understanding to guide frame extraction is superior to temporal-only sampling for SfM applications

## 2. Market Analysis Summary  
- **Existing Solutions**: SfM-Net, inter-frame attention mechanisms, and traditional saliency-based frame extraction exist
- **Gap Identification**: No solution combines DINOv3's semantic understanding with FFmpeg for SfM-optimized adaptive extraction
- **Build vs Buy Recommendation**: Build - custom development justified due to unique technical approach

## 3. Strategic Decision: BUILD
- **Decision Rationale**: DINOv3's dense features offer superior semantic understanding compared to existing saliency methods
- **Recommended Approach**: Custom development integrating mature components (FFmpeg + DINOv3)
